WCF Monitoring Proxy

To use:
 - Reference the WcfMonitoring project
 - Derive from WcfProxyMonitor<T> just as you would ClientBase<T>
 - Connect as you want
 
This proxy will cache the state of all the proxy objects that derive from it.  As it hooks 
	to the events from the ChannelFactory. 
	
The values cached are:

	public ProxyState ProxyState { get; set; }

	public CommunicationState CommState { get; set; }

	public int InstanceId { get; set; }

	public Uri ConnectionVia { get; set; }

	public EndpointAddress Endpoint { get; set; }

	public DateTime LastUpdate { get; set; }

	public string ProxyType { get; set; }

	public Guid Guid { get; set; }
	
To Display the cache call:

	class StateHandler
	public static Dictionary<int, ConnectionState> GetConnectionStates()
	
	from the same process from where you are connecting.
	
WcfConsole.Program.cs shows and example of displaying the cached values from the console program. 
	
	Thanks
